### I. Biome Overview: The Cauldron of Orol-Zul

*   **Physical Geography:**
    The Cauldron is a massive, semi-spherical cavern dominated by a high-pressure geothermal floor. The atmosphere is dense, humid, and perpetually warm (averaging 35°C/95°F), characterized by a rhythmic "breathing" as geysers erupt on a predictable cycle. Visibility is low due to constant steam fog, illuminated only by the dull cherry-red glow of magma fissures and the sickly green bioluminescence of hanging mosses. The ground is a treacherous crust of silica sinter and cooled basalt, punctuated by boiling mud pots and vertical "chimney" vents rising up to fifty feet high.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Thermadorin ("Brew-Dwarves")**
    Physiologically distinct from surface dwarves, the Thermadorin possess hairless, slate-grey skin (hair traps too much heat) and wide, filtration-heavy noses to process sulfurous air. They are hyper-metabolic; their bodies run hot, requiring immense caloric intake. Psychologically, they are jovial, loud, and communal, driven by a philosophy of "Fluidity"—life is short and hot, so it must flow like good ale. They are master biochemists rather than smiths, viewing the fermentation process as the divine rhythm of the universe.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food & Water:** The Thermadorin do not "eat" solid meals often. They process 90% of their calories through **Nutrient Stouts**—thick, porridgy, fermented beverages brewed from the giant vent-flora. Water is collected via massive copper "Condensation Sails" stretched across the cavern ceiling, dripping distilled steam into collection vats.
    *   **Shelter:** They carve homes directly into the cooler, upper stalactites, living upside down relative to the burning floor to escape the lethal ground heat while sleeping.
    *   **Sanitation/Waste:** The "Slag-Flush." All biological waste is channeled into ceramic pipes that lead directly into active lava flows or hyper-acidic boiling pools, ensuring instant sterilization and preventing plague in the humid environment.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Yeast-Mothers/Fathers:** The keepers of the "Mother Dough" and microbial cultures. They control the food supply and possess the secret knowledge of chemistry.
    2.  **The Gauge-Watchers:** A pragmatic order that monitors pressure valves on the geothermal vents. They predict eruptions and control the steam heat used for the massive city-wide stills.
    3.  **The Hall of Toasts:** A meritocratic council of elders who judge disputes over public drinking sessions. If a dispute cannot be settled with words, it is settled by a drinking contest of high-toxicity spirits.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **Class System:** Based on Palate. *The Sommeliers* (leaders/judges) are at the top, followed by *The Brewers* (craftsmen), *The Harvesters* (laborers who brave the vents), and finally *The Dregs* (those with no sense of taste, relegated to cleaning waste pipes).
    *   **Law:** The primary law is "Do Not Spoil the Batch." Contaminating a community vat or wasting water is a capital offense, usually punished by "The Parboil" (being tied near a steam vent).

### III. Ecological Survey

#### Flora & Fungi (Vegetation adapted to heat & mineral absorption)
1.  **Iron-Husk Barley:** A towering, bamboo-like grass with metallic husks. It draws iron from the soil, making it nearly uncuttable without diamond tools.
2.  **Vent-Anchor Root:** Massive tubers that plug directly into steam vents, swelling with starchy, boiling sap.
3.  **Sugar-Sponge Moss:** Grows on the underside of rock overhangs; drips a supersaturated glucose slime when exposed to steam.
4.  **Distiller’s Pitcher:** A carnivorous plant shaped like a pot; it naturally ferments insects that fall in, creating a crude, naturally occurring alcohol.
5.  **Sulfur-Capped Morel:** A giant mushroom that converts sulfur into protein. Toxic if not boiled for 12 hours.
6.  **Copper-Vein Creeper:** A vine that absorbs high amounts of copper; used by dwarves to create wiring for kegs and structural binding.
7.  **Steam-Lily:** Opens only during geyser eruptions to catch mineral spray; its pollen is a potent hallucinogen.
8.  **Filter-Frond:** Ferns that grow near toxic pools, actively pulling heavy metals out of the water.
9.  **Yeast-Cloud Puffball:** Releases spores that act as a natural fermentation starter; the air around them smells of baking bread.
10. **Lantern-Gourd:** Bioluminescent fruit hanging from vines; used as portable light sources by Harvesters.

#### Bestiary (Fauna adapted to high humidity & heat)
1.  **Boiler-Crab:** Car-sized crustaceans with thick, ceramic-like shells. They graze on Iron-Husk Barley and are the primary source of meat.
2.  **Steam-Ray:** A flat, membranous flyer that rides thermal updrafts. It never lands, sleeping on the wing.
3.  **Vat-Leech:** A parasite the size of a cat that tries to bore into fermentation barrels to drink the alcohol.
4.  **Salamander-Hound:** Amphibious pack hunters with slime-coated skin that prevents burns. Kept as pets by the Thermadorin.
5.  **Geyser-Worm:** Tube worms that grow to 30 feet, snapping at prey that wanders too close to the vents.
6.  **Condensation-Moth:** Giant moths (wingspan 2ft) that land on creatures to drink their sweat. Harmless but annoying.
7.  **Basalt-Mimic Beetle:** An ambush predator that looks exactly like a cooling lava rock.
8.  **Thermophile-Slug:** Massive, yellow slugs that eat Sulfur-Capped Morels. Their slime is a potent industrial lubricant.
9.  **Glass-Winged Sniper:** A dragonfly-like insect that shoots superheated water jets to stun prey.
10. **Dreg-Rat:** Hairless rodents that scavenge the waste pipes. They are immune to most poisons.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Ethanol/Bio-fuel:** Produced in massive quantities, enough to power engines (though they drink it).
    *   **Chitin:** Harvested from Boiler-Crabs for armor and building material.
    *   **Sugar/Starch:** Abundant from the hyper-growth of vent vegetation.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian & Basalt:** Used for construction and blades (sharper than steel but brittle).
    *   **Pumice:** Used for filtration and abrasive cleaning.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources (The Uncomprehended):**
    1.  **Hyper-Conductive Graphene:** The "soot" scraped off the coolest vents is actually naturally forming graphene. The dwarves use it as black face paint for festivals, unaware it is a superconductor that could revolutionize electronics.
    2.  **Lithium Brine:** The milky white water in the lower pools is rich in lithium. The dwarves call it "Sour-Water" and avoid it, unaware it is the key to advanced battery technology.
    3.  **Extremophile Enzymes:** The bacteria living in the hottest vents produce enzymes capable of rapid cellular regeneration (healing). The dwarves use the mud for "beauty masks," not realizing the biological immortality potential if isolated.
