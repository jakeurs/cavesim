### I. Biome Overview: The Cinder-Lung Basin

*   **Physical Geography:**
    The Cinder-Lung Basin is a colossal, enclosed geode-like cavern, spanning roughly 40 square kilometers. The floor is a treacherous landscape of jagged basalt and bubbling mineral pools, dominated by towering "Chimneys"—hydrothermal vents that spew superheated, mineral-rich steam.
    *   **Lighting:** The area is bathed in a perpetual, bloody twilight. Illumination comes from the dull red incandescence of magma veins visible through thin crust and vast colonies of bioluminescent thermophiles clinging to the Chimneys.
    *   **Hydrology:** The water cycle is aggressive and contained. Steam erupts from the vents, collects on the cooler crystalline ceiling, and rains down as scalding, acidic precipitation. This runoff collects in "The Soup"—turbid, greenish pools rich in dissolved sulfides.
    *   **Atmosphere:** The air is thick, reaching 95% humidity with temperatures averaging 45°C (113°F). It smells of rotten eggs (sulfur), wet copper, and musk.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Vermilion Kobolds (Homo saurus thermophilus)**
    Distinct from surface cousins, these Kobolds have evolved leathery, heat-resistant scales ranging from rust-red to obsidian-black. They are hairless, possess nictitating membranes to protect eyes from steam, and have hyper-active metabolisms. Psychologically, they are manic and communal; life is short, fast, and loud. They view "Silence" as synonymous with "Death."

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The Kobolds farm rapid-growth fungi on the vents and harvest giant arthropods. Due to their high metabolism, they must eat 6 times a day.
    *   **Water:** They use complex condensation traps made of giant leaves to catch steam *before* it hits the sulfur pools, filtering it through charcoal.
    *   **Shelter:** They do not build houses; they bore into the cooling lava tubes of the upper walls, living in honeycomb-like warrens.
    *   **Sanitation:** With a rapidly breeding population, waste is a crisis. It is collected and dumped into " The Burners"—active lava flows—effectively incinerating bio-hazards, though the smoke adds to the cavern's smog.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Thermotheurges (The Heat-Watchers):** Shamans who interpret the geological rumblings. They predict eruptions and vent blowouts. Their word is absolute regarding where to build or harvest.
    2.  **The Brood-Queens:** In a species that lays clutches of 20 eggs monthly, the fertile females control the demographics. They decide who mates and which clutches are culled during famine.
    3.  **The Gear-Keepers:** Custodians of crude mechanical elevators and pumps powered by steam pressure. They maintain the infrastructure that keeps the colony from drowning in the rising waters.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **The Caste System:** Based on heat tolerance.
        *   *Ash-Walkers (High Class):* Can withstand temperatures near the vents; they harvest the best food.
        *   *Rim-Dwellers (Low Class):* Weaker scales, forced to live in the "cold" (25°C) outskirts, doing menial labor.
    *   **Law:** Justice is immediate. Crimes (theft, wasting water) result in "The Cooling"—exile to the freezing dark tunnels outside the Basin, a sentence worse than death to these heat-dependent creatures.

### III. Ecological Survey

*   **Flora & Fungi (Chemosynthetic & Thermophilic):**
    1.  **Chimney-Clasper:** A thick, woody vine that spirals up vents; its bark is essentially cork, insulating the plant while its roots tap the minerals.
    2.  **Iron-Cap Mushroom:** A metallic-sheathed fungus. Edible only if boiled for hours to remove heavy metals.
    3.  **Steam-Pitcher:** A carnivorous giant pitcher plant that fills with hot water, boiling unlucky insects (or Kobold pups) that fall in.
    4.  **Sulfur-Cotton:** Grows in fluffy yellow clumps. Highly flammable, used by Kobolds for tinder and bedding.
    5.  **Glass-Bamboo:** Silica-rich stalks that grow inches per hour. Used for construction and spears.
    6.  **Blister-Algae:** Forms thick, gelatinous mats on the water. A staple "gruel" food source.
    7.  **Vent-Orchid:** A flower that blooms only during eruptions; its pollen is a potent hallucinogen.
    8.  **Ash-Moss:** Grey carpet moss that filters toxins from the air; Kobolds weave it into breathing masks.
    9.  **Copper-Root:** A fern that conducts electricity; touching a field of these during a static storm is fatal.
    10. **Magma-Melon:** Thick-rinded fruit containing pressurized, boiling nectar. Explodes if cut improperly.

*   **Bestiary:**
    1.  **Plated Vent-Crab:** The size of a shield, these scavengers keep the ecosystem clean. Their shells are used for Kobold armor.
    2.  **Steam-Strider:** A 2-meter tall arachnid that walks above the scalding pools on stilt-like legs.
    3.  **Basalt-Borer Beetle:** Eats rock and excretes sand. Vital for creating flat terrain.
    4.  **Furnace-Salamander:** A domesticated amphibian that radiates heat. Kobolds use them as living bed-warmers.
    5.  **Tunnel-Gulper:** A blind, serpentine predator that bursts from the ground to swallow prey whole. The apex predator.
    6.  **Soot-Moth:** Hand-sized insects that feed on ash; their wings are used for crude parchment.
    7.  **Geyser-Leech:** Parasites that attach to the vents (or scaly skin) to suck blood and mineral fluids.
    8.  **Obsidian-Wing Bat:** Uses echolocation to hunt Soot-Moths. Their guano is a key fertilizer.
    9.  **Slag-Rat:** A hairless, armored rodent that infests Kobold food stores.
    10. **Thermal-Jelly:** Airborne jellyfish-like creatures that float on rising heat thermals, stinging with acid tentacles.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Chitin:** Massive amounts from the crab and beetle populations, used for tools and structures.
    *   **Fungal Protein:** Rapid-growth mushrooms allow for sustainable high-population density.
    *   **Geothermal Energy:** Infinite heat for cooking, smithing, and sterilization.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Basalt & Obsidian:** Primary construction materials and cutting edges.
    *   **Native Sulfur:** Used for simple alchemy and explosives.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources:**
    1.  **Rare Earth Sludge (Neodymium/Dysprosium):** The mud at the bottom of "The Soup" is rich in magnetic rare earth elements. The Kobolds use it as "war paint" because it tingles, unaware it is worth a fortune to surface tech industries.
    2.  **Precursor Geothermal Taps:** The "Chimneys" are actually calcified, ancient terraforming pipes. The Kobolds worship the metallic rumbles deep inside, unaware they are living on top of a dormant planetary engine.
    3.  **Hyper-Conductive Crystals:** Crystalline formations near the hottest vents are room-temperature superconductors. The Kobolds use them as "glitter rocks" to decorate the nests of Brood-Queens, ignoring their energy-revolutionizing potential.
