### I. Biome Overview: The Sulfur-Root Caldera

*   **Physical Geography:**
    This biome, designated the "Sulfur-Root Caldera," exists within a colossal, hollowed-out subterranean pocket roughly 4 kilometers in diameter. The geological floor is a thin crust over an active magma chamber, riddled with hundreds of high-pressure hydrothermal vents. The atmosphere is thick, humid, and hazy, smelling constantly of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide) and wet stone.
    *   **Lighting:** There is no celestial light. The primary illumination comes from the "Ember-Moss" carpeting the ceiling and the dull, ominous red glow of the hottest vents. Visibility is poor, obscured by perpetual steam clouds.
    *   **Hydrology:** Water does not rain down; it erupts up. Superheated, mineral-laden geysers spray into the air, condensing on the cavern ceiling and raining back down into cooling pools. This creates a closed, high-salinity water cycle.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Talpidae (The Ash-Diggers)**
    *   **Physical:** The Talpidae are hunched, bipedal mole-kin standing roughly 1.2 meters tall. They possess velvety, heat-resistant fur (ranging from slate grey to soot black) and massive, shovel-like claws on their forelimbs. Their eyes are vestigial white orbs, useless for sight; they rely entirely on vibrissae (whiskers) that detect tremors and air currents, and an acute sense of smell.
    *   **Psychology:** Intensely xenophobic and territorial. They view the "Silent Dark" (areas away from their vents) as the realm of death and demons. Any outsider is perceived as a resource thief or a biological contaminant and is typically killed on sight to "purify" the air.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The Talpidae practice "chemo-agriculture." They farm giant tube-worms and harvest fungi that grow on the mineral deposits of the vents.
    *   **Water:** They construct condensation traps—large basalt bowls—under the steam clouds to capture distilled water before it hits the brine pools.
    *   **Shelter:** They do not build *up*; they dig *in*. Homes are burrowed directly into the cooling solidified lava flows (obsidian/basalt) surrounding the vents, utilizing the geothermal heat to survive.
    *   **Sanitation:** Waste is strictly managed. Biological waste is carried to the "Rot-Pits" on the far periphery to feed the Nitre-Beetle farms (a secondary food source). Dead Talpidae are fed to the magma to return their heat to the earth.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Seismonks:** A priestly caste who press their ears to the bedrock to interpret the "heartbeat" of the magma. They predict eruptions and vent shifts.
    2.  **The Vent-Wardens:** Hydraulic engineers/warriors who maintain the physical structure of the vent-gardens, clearing blockages and defending against predators.
    3.  **The Brood-Mothers:** The reproductive authorities. In a resource-scarce environment, permission to breed is strictly controlled by the matriarchs based on food surplus.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **The Heat-Law:** Status is determined by proximity to the vents.
        *   *The Core (High Caste):* Live next to the steadiest, warmest vents. Seismonks and Brood-Mothers.
        *   *The Steam (Warrior/Worker Caste):* Live in the humid mid-zone.
        *   *The Chill (Outcasts/Criminals):* Forced to live on the cold, dark periphery where the vents die out. This is a death sentence, usually due to hypothermia or predation.
    *   **Law Enforcement:** Disputes are settled by "Tremor-Duels"—non-lethal wrestling matches to pin the opponent, minimizing bloodshed which attracts predators.

### III. Ecological Survey

*   **Flora & Fungi (Chemosynthetic & Thermophilic):**
    1.  **Iron-Bark Tube Tree:** Not a tree, but a calcified giant tube worm colony that grows vertically. The Talpidae tap it for a blood-like, iron-rich sap.
    2.  **Sulfur-Cap Mushroom:** Bright yellow fungi that metabolize sulfur. Toxic to outsiders, but a staple carbohydrate for the Talpidae.
    3.  **Weeping Steam-Vine:** Hangs from the ceiling, absorbing steam. Its leaves drip potable water, often cultivated over cisterns.
    4.  **Ember-Moss:** Bioluminescent ground cover that produces heat and a low-light glow. Used as bedding.
    5.  **Razor-Fern:** Plants with silica-infused, sharp leaves. Planted as defensive perimeters around burrows.
    6.  **Filter-Fronds:** Large, fan-like organisms that scrub toxins from the air. Vital for breathable pockets near aggressive vents.
    7.  **Magma-Melons:** Thick-rinded spherical fruit that grows partially submerged in hot mud. Inside is a spicy, gelatinous pulp.
    8.  **Ash-Cotton:** A fibrous grey lichen that can be spun into fire-resistant thread/clothing.
    9.  **Crystal-Bulb:** A root vegetable that grows inside porous rock; requires heavy tools to harvest.
    10. **Ghost-Spore:** A parasitic fungus that infects dead tissue; used by the Talpidae to accelerate composting in the Rot-Pits.

*   **Bestiary:**
    1.  **Vent-Leviathan:** A massive, armored serpentine amphibian that swims in the boiling brine pools. The apex predator.
    2.  **Armored Isopod (The "Tank-Bug"):** Dog-sized pill bugs. Domesticated by the Talpidae as beasts of burden and mounts.
    3.  **Steam-Strider:** Spindly, long-legged arachnids that walk *over* the steam clouds on the ceiling, dropping sticky threads to catch prey.
    4.  **Drill-Beetle:** Size of a cat, possessing a rotating, conical beak. Pests that bore into the Talpidae's walls.
    5.  **Echo-Bat:** Blind, leather-winged flyers that use high-frequency echolocation. They roost in the cooling towers.
    6.  **Slag-Slug:** Massive gastropods that eat rock and excrete a cement-like paste. Talpidae use their trails to reinforce tunnels.
    7.  **Thermalskin Salamander:** Small lizards that sleep in fire. Their skin is harvested for high-grade heat insulation.
    8.  **Needle-Fly:** Swarming insects that seek soft tissue to lay eggs. A constant plague for the Talpidae.
    9.  **Trap-Door Crab:** Camouflaged crabs that mimic volcanic rock, waiting to snap at passing feet.
    10. **The Whispering Polyp:** A stationary, coral-like animal that mimics the sounds of distressed prey to lure scavengers.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Chitin Plate:** Harvested from Isopods and Beetles (used for armor/tools).
    *   **Sulfur:** Scraped from vents (used for pyrotechnics/medicine).
    *   **Fungal Silk:** From Ash-Cotton (textiles).
    *   **Geothermal Energy:** Heat is used for cooking, forging, and incubation.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian:** Used for supreme cutting edges (knives, spear tips).
    *   **Basalt:** Building material.
    *   **Iron Ore:** Found in nodules near the vents, crudely smelted.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources:**
    1.  **"Sun-Stones" (Raw Uranium/Pitchblende):**
        *   *Local Use:* The Talpidae prize these heavy, warm rocks as "Eternal Bed-Warmers" for the nurseries.
        *   *Reality:* They are highly radioactive. The high infant mortality rate of the Talpidae is not due to nature, but radiation poisoning from their "sacred" warmth stones.
    2.  **"God-Glass" (Fiber Optic Bundles):**
        *   *Local Use:* Thick cables of ancient, fused glass found deep in the bedrock. The Seismonks use them as musical instruments (percussion).
        *   *Reality:* Remnants of a high-speed data trunk from a pre-apocalypse civilization, mostly fused by heat, but some strands still carry faint, incomprehensible light pulses.
    3.  **"The Titan's Breath" (Liquid Helium leak):**
        *   *Local Use:* A specific vent that blows "burning cold" air. It is used as an execution chamber for the worst criminals (instant freezing).
        *   *Reality:* A rupture in a subterranean super-collider cooling system. The helium is invaluable, but the Talpidae only know it as the "Ice Death."
