### I. Biome Overview: The Scalded Basin

*   **Physical Geography:**
    This biome occupies a massive, semi-spherical cavern formed by ancient volcanic collapse. The floor is a treacherous wetlands of boiling mud pots, shallow acidic lakes, and towering "chimneys"—calcium-carbonate spires that spew superheated, mineral-rich water. The ceiling is lost in a perpetual dense fog bank formed by rising steam meeting the cooler rock above. This "ceiling rain" creates a constant, warm drizzle.
    *   **Lighting:** The primary illumination comes from *Chemo-luminescent* algae mats clinging to the vent chimneys, glowing a dull, sickly green. Erupting vents provide sporadic flashes of deep orange thermal light.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Heavy, humid, and sulfurous. The air is thick with moisture and smells of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide). Oxygen levels are barely sufficient for surface-dwellers, leading to fatigue in visitors.

*   **The Sentient Species: The *Vaporin* (Pale Gnomes)**
    *   **Morphology:** Standing roughly 3 feet tall, the Vaporin possess hairless, alabaster-white skin that is thick and rubbery, resembling dolphin flesh, to repel fungal infections and scalding water. They have oversized, flat feet (webbed) for traversing mud, and large, solid-black eyes protected by transparent nictitating membranes.
    *   **Psychology:** Highly communal but fiercely territorial regarding heat sources. They are stoic, having adapted to a life where a wrong step means boiling to death. They view the "Surface" as a mythical frozen hell.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The diet consists primarily of *Vent-Crabs* (protein) and *Sulfur-Cap* stew. They practice aquaculture, walling off cooling pools to raise *Glass-Eels*.
    *   **Water:** Despite the abundance of water, most is toxic. They rely on "Condensation Catchers"—great stretched tarps of fungal leather that catch the ceiling rain (distilled by evaporation) and funnel it into clay cisterns.
    *   **Shelter:** They carve homes directly into the cooler, fossilized vent chimneys. These towers are naturally insulated and sit above the mud-line.
    *   **Sanitation:** Waste is strictly managed to prevent disease in the humid air. Biological waste is collected and dumped into "The Gullet," a specific active fissure that incinerates matter instantly.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Pressure-Keepers:** A caste of geomancers who listen to the earth's groans. They predict super-eruptions and dictate when to evacuate specific zones. Their word is absolute law during a "Tremor."
    2.  **The Carapace Guild:** Craftsmen who work with the chitin of giant crustaceans. Since metal rusts instantly here, chitin is the primary material for tools, weapons, and structural support. They control the means of production.
    3.  **The Mist-Mothers:** A matriarchal spiritual order that tends to the *Spore-Banks*. They control the food supply (fungal farming) and perform funeral rites, where bodies are fed to the sacred *Slag-Beetles*.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **The Thermal Aristocracy:** Status is determined by the elevation of one's home. The wealthiest live in the "Mid-Spire" (warm, dry, safe from mud). The poor live in the "Mud-Skirts" (damp, prone to flooding and scalding).
    *   **Law:** Crime is rare due to interdependence, but theft of fresh water is the highest heresy. Punishment is "The Cold Exile"—the offender is stripped of protective gear and banished to the chilly, dark periphery of the cave system to die of hypothermia or predation.

### III. Ecological Survey

#### Flora & Fungi (Vegetation & Mycology)
1.  **Iron-Root Mangrove:** Massive, stone-like trees that tap directly into magma veins for minerals. Their roots form the only stable bridges over mud pits.
2.  **Sulfur-Cap Mushroom:** Bright yellow fungi that metabolize sulfur. Edible if boiled three times; poisonous if raw.
3.  **Weeping Steam-Vine:** Hangs from the ceiling. Its leaves are hydrophobic, channeling condensation down to its roots. Used by Vaporin for water collection.
4.  **Blister-Moss:** A reddish moss that grows on hot rocks. It is caustic to the touch, causing chemical burns.
5.  **Thermal Kelp:** Long, ribbon-like plants living in the boiling pools. They are harvested for fiber to weave nets.
6.  **Lantern-Lily:** A flower that houses bioluminescent bacteria in its bulb. Used by Vaporin as portable torches.
7.  **Filter-Reed:** Grows in the transition zones between toxic and clean water. Its hollow stems are used as blowguns and breathing snorkels.
8.  **Ash-Spore Puffball:** When disturbed, releases a cloud of choking, gray dust. Used as a natural smoke grenade/defense mechanism.
9.  **Crystal-Fern:** A rigid plant that absorbs silica, making its fronds sharp as glass. Used for arrowheads and knives.
10. **Vent-Cork:** A spongy, fast-growing fungus that plugs small gas leaks in the ground.

#### Bestiary (Fauna)
1.  **Titan Vent-Crab:** The size of a pony. Its shell is inch-thick chitin. It grazes on Thermal Kelp and is the primary beast of burden for the Vaporin.
2.  **Steam-Strider:** A 6-legged insect the size of a dog that skates on the surface tension of boiling water.
3.  **Blind Cave Salamander:** A smooth, white amphibian (4ft long) that senses vibrations. An ambush predator hiding in the mud.
4.  **Methane-Leech:** A balloon-like parasite that floats in the air, attaching to creatures to suck blood and store methane (highly flammable).
5.  **Rock-Borer Snail:** Fist-sized snails with acid-secreting feet that eat through stone to find minerals. Their shells are used as currency.
6.  **Vapor-Bat:** Leathery fliers that echolocate through the fog. They eat insects and sleep in the high warm updrafts.
7.  **Slag-Beetle:** The "Garbage Collectors." They eat excrement and carrion. Vaporin consider them sacred/necessary.
8.  **Glass-Eel:** Translucent fish living in the cooler perimeter pools. A staple food source.
9.  **Obsidian-Maw:** The Apex Predator. A 12-foot reptile with scales resembling black volcanic glass. It is immune to heat and hunts Vent-Crabs.
10. **Fog-Moth:** Giant, slow-moving moths with woolly coats that collect moisture. They pollinate the Lantern-Lilies.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Chitin:** Harvested from crabs and beetles; used for armor and building.
    *   **Fungal Silk:** Extracted from the stems of Steam-Vines.
    *   **Algal Paste:** Processed into a nutrient sludge.
    *   **Fresh Water:** Harvested via condensation traps.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian:** Used for supreme cutting edges.
    *   **Sulfur:** Harvested from vent rims for alchemy/medicine.
    *   **Pumice:** Used for sanding and filtration.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources (The Uncomprehended):**
    1.  **"Spirit-Paint" (Rare Earth Sludge):** Veins of iridescent mud containing high concentrations of Neodymium and Lithium. The Vaporin smear it on their faces for rituals. It is highly toxic but highly valuable to advanced electronics manufacturing.
    2.  **"Warm-Stones" (Depleted Uranium/Plutonium):** Heavy, dense rocks that are naturally warm to the touch due to radioactive decay. The Vaporin put them in their beds to stay warm at night. This causes widespread genetic mutation and shortened lifespans, which they attribute to "Ancestral Curses."
    3.  **"The God-Pipes" (Precursor Geothermal Conduits):** Indestructible ceramic-alloy pipes running deep under the biome. The Vaporin believe they are the bones of the world and tap on them to send messages (Morse-code like) to distant settlements, unaware these are actually parts of a dormant, planet-sized geothermal power plant.
