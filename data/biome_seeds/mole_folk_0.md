### I. Biome Overview: The Sulfur-Spire Caldera

*   **Physical Geography:**
    Located in a massive, enclosed geode-like cavern roughly 4 kilometers in diameter, the **Sulfur-Spire Caldera** is a high-pressure, high-humidity environment. The floor is dominated by a field of active hydrothermal vents and fumaroles, spewing mineral-rich steam and superheated water. The "ground" is a mix of cooling basalt, unstable mud pots, and calcified mineral shelves.
    *   **Lighting:** There is no celestial light. Illumination is provided by the dull red glow of exposed magma veins and the vibrant blue-green bioluminescence of chemotrophic mosses that thrive on the sulfur compounds in the air.
    *   **Atmosphere:** The air is dense, hot (averaging 35°C/95°F), and smells pungently of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide) and wet iron. Visibility is often poor due to thick fog banks generated by the steam.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Talpidae Ferrox ("The Steam-Diggers")**
    *   **Physicality:** A race of humanoid moles, standing approx. 1.5 meters tall. They possess barrel chests (for shouting and processing thin air), spade-like claws for digging through calcified rock, and thick, velvet-like fur that is hydrophobic and heat-resistant. Their eyes are vestigial, covered by skin; they navigate via seismic sense and echolocation.
    *   **Psychology:** The Steam-Diggers are aggressively gregarious. Living in a deafening environment of hissing steam and groaning earth, they have developed a culture of shouting, chest-beating, and tactile communication. They are fearless of heat but terrified of "The Silence" (cold areas). They are industrious, hedonistic, and deeply communal, believing that silence breeds madness.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The diet is primarily fungal and root-based. They harvest "Iron-Roots" from the giant vent-flora and hunt large insectoids. Food is cooked instantly by burying it in shallow hot-mud pits.
    *   **Water:** Drinking the vent water is toxic due to heavy metals. They rely on "Condensation Catchers"—large, polished obsidian slates placed high in the cool upper cavern to capture steam turning into rain. This distilled water is funneled into communal cisterns.
    *   **Shelter:** They do not live on the caldera floor (too hot/active). They bore intricate hive-tunnels into the limestone walls surrounding the heat source, creating distinct temperature zones for sleeping, birthing, and storage.
    *   **Sanitation:** Waste is collected in clay urns and dumped into "The Gullet"—a specific, hyper-active magma fissure. The intense heat incinerates the waste instantly, preventing disease in the humid environment.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Vent-Singers (Religious):** These elders interpret the geological activity. A sudden geyser eruption is a sign of divine anger; a steady flow is a blessing. They lead the "shout-prayers"—cacophonous chants meant to be heard by the earth.
    2.  **The Root-Barons (Economic):** The individuals who control the prime digging spots around the largest, most nutrient-dense Boiler-Trees. They distribute food in exchange for labor and loyalty.
    3.  **The Brew-Mothers (Social):** Keepers of the "Magma-Mead" (fermented fungal mash). In a society of constant noise and labor, the tavern-halls run by the Brew-Mothers are the center of political and social bonding.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **The Rumble Law:** Disputes are settled by "Shout-Matches" (volume and endurance contests) or "Claw-Wrestling." Lethal violence is taboo because every digger is needed for survival.
    *   **Class System:**
        *   *Top:* The Deep-Diggers (strongest laborers/explorers).
        *   *Middle:* Crafters (obsidian knappers, weavers).
        *   *Bottom:* The Cold-Ones (sick, elderly, or criminals exiled to the outer, unheated tunnels).

### III. Ecological Survey

*   **Flora & Fungi (Chemotrophs & Thermophiles):**
    1.  **Boiler-Bark Trees:** Massive, non-photosynthetic pillars that look like trees but are actually calcified tube-worm colonies and fungal symbiotes. They anchor directly into vents to siphon heat and minerals.
    2.  **Ironwood Tubers:** The primary carbohydrate source. These roots grow deep into the basalt, absorbing iron which gives the "wood" a metallic taste and extreme hardness.
    3.  **Sulfur-Cap Mushrooms:** Large, yellow bioluminescent fungi that grow on cooling lava. They emit a blue glow and are hallucinogenic if eaten raw.
    4.  **Steam-Pitcher Plants:** Giant, carnivorous basins that collect condensation. They trap small insects seeking water and digest them with acid.
    5.  **Vent-Vines:** Thick, fibrous ropes that dangle from the ceiling, absorbing rising steam. Used by the moles for weaving nets and hammocks.
    6.  **Ash-Moss:** A grey, fuzzy carpet that covers cool rocks. It acts as insulation for the moles' bedding.
    7.  **Magma-Ferns:** Red-leafed plants with silica-coated fronds that can withstand temperatures up to 100°C.
    8.  **Crystal-Lichens:** Sharp, crystalline growths that harvest minerals from the air. They are razor-sharp and used by moles as crude rasps/files.
    9.  **Ghost-Puffballs:** When disturbed, these release a cloud of white spores that mimics steam, confusing predators.
    10. **Heat-Seeker Creepers:** Parasitic vines that sense body heat. They will wrap around a sleeping animal (or mole) to siphon warmth, sometimes causing heatstroke.

*   **Bestiary:**
    1.  **Gravel-Maw Worm:** A 3-meter long segmented worm with diamond-hard teeth. It tunnels through rock and is the primary predator of the Boiler-Trees' roots (and careless moles).
    2.  **Obsidian Beetle:** Large scavenger beetles (size of a dinner plate) with shells as hard as glass. They eat dung and rotting organic matter.
    3.  **Steam-Strider:** A spider-like arachnid with immensely long legs, allowing it to walk over boiling mud pools to snatch surfacing larvae.
    4.  **Vent-Leech:** Airborne parasites that drift on steam currents, attaching to soft tissue to suck blood.
    5.  **Therma-Bat:** Blind, hairless flying mammals that use sonar. They roost in the high ceiling and swoop down to catch rising insects.
    6.  **Slag-Crab:** Heavily armored crustaceans that live near the hottest vents. They filter-feed on bacterial mats.
    7.  **Crystal-Spine Rat:** A rodent that incorporates dietary minerals into its fur, creating sharp, quill-like defenses.
    8.  **Ash-Newt:** Small, slippery amphibians that secrete a mucus allowing them to slide through narrow cracks. A common snack for the moles.
    9.  **Geyser-Glider:** A flying squirrel analogue with heat-resistant membranes. They ride the thermal updrafts from geysers to traverse the cavern.
    10. **Magma-Back Tortoise:** The apex herbivore. Size of a small car. Its shell is made of accumulated basalt and sulfur deposits. It grazes slowly on the Boiler-Trees and is virtually indestructible.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Fungal Silk:** Harvested from the stems of Sulfur-Caps for clothing.
    *   **Chitin:** Plates from Obsidian Beetles used for armor and shields.
    *   **Potable Water:** Harvested via condensation.
    *   **Food:** Tubers and insect meat.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian:** High-quality volcanic glass for blades and tools.
    *   **Pumice:** Used for grinding and cleaning.
    *   **Sulfur:** Harvested for medicinal pastes and fire-starting.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources:**
    1.  **Rare Earth Sludge (Neodymium/Lithium):** The mud pots are rich in rare earth elements essential for advanced electronics. The Steam-Diggers use this glittery mud as "War Paint" for festivals, unaware of its magnetic properties or value to surface civilizations.
    2.  **The "Humming Stones" (Cobalt-60/Uranium Ore):** Veins of radioactive ore that remain warm forever without fire. The elite Steam-Diggers keep these stones under their beds as "Ever-Warmers." This causes significantly lower life expectancies among the ruling class due to radiation poisoning, which they attribute to "The Burden of Leadership."
    3.  **Precursor Geothermal Caps:** Beneath the three largest vents are ancient, artificial metallic caps (titanium alloy) placed by a lost civilization to regulate pressure. The moles believe these are the "Iron Skulls of the Gods" and beat on them with hammers during rituals. This percussion transmits rhythmic vibrations that can be detected by sensors thousands of miles away, though the moles do not know they are signaling anyone.
