### I. Biome Overview: The Vitreous Hothouse

*   **Physical Geography:**
    Located deep within the crustal intersection of active tectonic plates, the Vitreous Hothouse is a colossal, spherical cavern centered around a cluster of high-output hydrothermal vents. The geology is dominated by smooth, black obsidian floors and jagged pumice ceilings. The atmosphere is oppressive—100% humidity, temperatures averaging 45°C (113°F), and air heavy with sulfur and metallic particulate. Visibility is low due to constant steam clouds, illuminated only by the dull, rhythmic crimson pulse of the vents and the pale green bioluminescence of chemosynthetic mosses. A "hydro-cycle" exists entirely within the cave: steam rises, condenses on the cool upper stalactites, and rains back down as scalding, mineral-rich precipitation.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Thermoliths (Vulcanis Custos)**
    The "Trolls" of this region are not the brutish raiders of surface lore. The Thermoliths are massive, slow-moving bipeds standing 8-10 feet tall with hide resembling cracked basalt. They are hairless, possessing instead patches of symbiotic, moss-like growth on their shoulders and backs that help regulate their body temperature. Their eyes are vestigial milky orbs; they see the world entirely through *thermoception* (heat sensing) and vibration. They are a contemplative, stoic species, acting as gardeners rather than warriors. Their psychology is driven by "Thermal Equilibrium"—the avoidance of emotional or physical extremes.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The Thermoliths practice "Geothermal Agriculture." They cultivate the Titan-Roots (see Flora), peeling back the bark to eat the starch-rich, sugary cambium layer. They also farm giant subterranean crustaceans.
    *   **Water:** They cannot drink the sulfur-heavy vent water directly. They construct massive filtration cisterns using layers of charcoal and pumice to purify the rain collected from the ceiling drip-zones.
    *   **Shelter:** They do not build houses; they carve sleeping niches directly into the cooling lava flows or hollow out the base of dead Titan-Roots.
    *   **Sanitation:** Waste management is a sacred duty. All biological waste (and the dead) is macerated into a slurry and fed into the "Maw of the Earth" (the active vents) to return nutrients to the cycle, accelerating the growth of the vegetation.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Valve-Keepers (Pragmatic/Engineering):** A caste dedicated to placing and maintaining large stone caps on the vents to regulate pressure. If they fail, the cavern could explode or freeze. They hold the power of life and death.
    2.  **The Mycelial Oracles (Spiritual):** Elders who consume hallucinogenic spores from the deep-heat fungi. They claim to hear the "heartbeat of the stone" and dictate when to harvest and when to rest.
    3.  **The Brood-Wardens (Social):** Because Thermolith reproduction is slow (one offspring every 20 years), the Wardens raise all children communally. They have absolute authority over dispute resolution to ensure the safety of the young.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    The society operates on a caste system defined by **Heat Tolerance**.
    *   *The Core-Walkers:* The ruling class, capable of withstanding the intense heat near the vents. They manage the agriculture.
    *   *The Rim-Dwellers:* Those with weaker constitutions who live in the cooler, outer edges. They do the menial labor of water filtration and waste hauling.
    *   **Law:** Law is enforcement of equilibrium. Theft or violence disrupts the "Social Temperature." Punishment involves "Cooling"—being exiled to the furthest, coldest reaches of the cave without heat-packs, a sentence that leads to lethargy and eventual hibernation/death.

### III. Ecological Survey

*   **Flora & Fungi (The Chemo-Garden):**
    1.  **Titan-Root:** The dominant organism. Massive, tree-like tubers that anchor *into* the vents. They have no leaves, only thick, green, vein-covered trunks that absorb heat and sulfur.
    2.  **Glass-Vines:** Translucent, silica-based vines that hang from the ceiling to catch steam. Extremely sharp/durable, used for tools.
    3.  **Steam-Moss:** A carpet of pale green fuzz that covers the floor, converting ambient heat into chemical energy. Edible but gritty.
    4.  **Sulfur-Cups:** Large, yellow, bowl-shaped fungi that collect condensation. The water inside is acidic but useful for tanning hides.
    5.  **Iron-Bark Shrub:** A bush that absorbs dissolved metals, creating bark as hard as low-grade steel. Used for weapons/armor.
    6.  **Lantern-Polyps:** Bioluminescent fungal bulbs that grow on the Titan-Roots, provided the only non-thermal light in the cave.
    7.  **Filter-Fronds:** Fern-like organisms that trap airborne ash. They are harvested and burned as incense.
    8.  **Blister-Pods:** Explosive flora. If touched, they burst with boiling sap. Used by Thermoliths as primitive grenades/traps.
    9.  **Weeping-Lichen:** Hangs in wet sheets; wrings out fresh water when squeezed. A vital emergency hydration source.
    10. **Carrion-Flower:** A massive, heat-generating flower that smells of rotting meat to attract scavengers for pollination.

*   **Bestiary (The Heat-Seekers):**
    1.  **Obsidian Crab:** Car-sized crustaceans with black, rock-like shells. They are the primary livestock of the Thermoliths.
    2.  **Vent-Glider:** Leathery, bat-like creatures that ride the thermal updrafts. They never land, sleeping on the wing.
    3.  **Ash-Stalker:** A six-legged, salamander-like predator with thermal camouflage. It hunts the Rim-Dwellers if they stray too far.
    4.  **Drill-Worm:** One meter long worms with diamond-hard beaks that aerate the soil around the Titan-Roots.
    5.  **Steam-Strider:** Delicate, spider-like insects that walk on the surface tension of the boiling pools.
    6.  **Silica-Weaver:** A large arachnid that spins webs of spun glass. The webs are invisible in the steam.
    7.  **Boiler-Leech:** Parasites that attach to the Thermoliths, sucking their blood while injecting a numbing agent.
    8.  **Geyser-Slug:** Massive, bloated slugs that eat sulfur deposits. Their slime is a potent adhesive.
    9.  **Echo-Bat:** Blind flying mammals that use high-frequency sonar to navigate the steam clouds.
    10. **Slag-Rat:** Rodents with metallic teeth capable of chewing through Iron-Bark. A major pest to food stores.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Titan-Starch:** High-calorie food paste derived from the roots.
    *   **Chitin:** Armor plates from the Obsidian Crabs.
    *   **Glass-Fiber:** Rope and textiles made from processed Glass-Vines.
    *   **Fungal Silk:** From the Silica-Weaver webs.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian:** Used for knapping unbelievably sharp cutting tools.
    *   **Native Sulfur:** Used for medicine and adhesives.
    *   **Pumice:** Used for construction and filtration.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources (The Uncomprehended):**
    1.  **"God-Blood" (Mercury):** Pools of liquid mercury are found in the lower depressions. The Thermoliths use it as ritual body paint for the dead. They do not understand it is a neurotoxin causing the "Madness of the Elders" among the priests who handle it.
    2.  **"Humming-Stones" (Radioactive Isotopes/Cobalt-60):** Veins of glowing blue ore found near the hottest vents. The Thermoliths prize them as "eternal bed-warmers" and carry them in pouches. This causes chronic radiation sickness, which they attribute to "spiritual weakness."
    3.  **"The Ancient Roots" (Geothermal Conduits):** Sometimes, digging reveals pipes made of advanced, rust-proof alloys (remnants of a lost technological age). The Thermoliths believe these are the fossilized bones of gods and refuse to damage them, unaware they could tap them for clean electricity or refined metals.
