### I. Biome Overview: The Caldera of Weeping Stone

*   **Physical Geography:**
    This biome, known locally as the *Vapor-Vault*, is a colossal, spherical cavern located approximately 4 kilometers beneath the crust. The floor is dominated by a field of active hydrothermal vents and mud-pots, constantly spewing superheated, mineral-rich water geysers. The ceiling is a dripping stalactite forest where the steam condenses, creating a perpetual, scalding rain.
    *   **Lighting:** There is no celestial light. Illumination is provided by the dull, malevolent red glow of the magma veins beneath the thin crust, and the bioluminescent *Sulfur-Moss* that coats the upper cavern walls in a sickly green hue.
    *   **Atmosphere:** The air is thick, humid (90-100% saturation), and smells violently of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide) and wet fur. The temperature ranges from a "comfortable" 40°C (104°F) at the edges to a lethal 120°C (248°F) near the central vents.

*   **The Sentient Species: The Thermikor (The Ash-Gnomes)**
    *   **Physical Description:** Standing roughly 3 feet tall, the Thermikor are covered in dense, wire-like hair that is grey or white. Biologically, this fur is not for warmth, but acts as an ablative heat-shield, protecting their skin from steam burns and falling hot water. Beneath the fur, their skin is leathery and thick. They possess large, obsidian-black eyes with nictitating membranes to protect against sulfur gas.
    *   **Psychological Profile:** Highly evangelical and xenophobic. They believe the "Great Hiss" (the sound of escaping steam) is the voice of god. They view "The Cold" as a metaphysical sin and are obsessed with thermal expansion—physically widening the vents to bring more heat to the world.

### II. The Society

*   **Survival Loop:**
    *   **Food:** The Thermikor practice "Vertical Hydroponics." They build trellises of bone and stone around the vents to grow heat-loving fungi and slime-molds. Protein comes from herding *Vent-Hogs* and trapping giant insects.
    *   **Water:** Drinking water is difficult; the vent water is toxic with heavy metals. They rely on "Condenser Totems"—intricate stone carvings placed in cooler pockets of the cave that collect condensation, trickling it through charcoal filters (burnt fungal matter) into clean reservoirs.
    *   **Shelter:** They dwell in "Tube-Hives," dwelling units carved out of the massive, calcified mineral deposits left by millennia of geyser eruptions. These towers are naturally warm and defensible.
    *   **Sanitation/Waste:** In the sweltering heat, disease breeds instantly. The Thermikor have a strict taboos regarding waste. All excrement and dead bodies are cast into the "Purifier"—a specific fissure that drops directly into a magma flow. Urinating near a food source is punishable by branding.

*   **Pillars of Authority:**
    1.  **The Cantor of the Hiss (Religious):** The highest authority. A high priest who interprets the varying pressures and sounds of the steam vents to dictate the will of the planet.
    2.  **The Valve-Keepers (Pragmatic):** Strong laborers responsible for physically plugging or opening steam fissures to regulate the cavern’s temperature and prevent explosive decompressions.
    3.  **The Groom-Mothers (Social):** Matriarchs who control the social hierarchy through grooming. In a society of intense heat, parasites are lethal; being groomed is a sign of acceptance. To be "Ungroomed" is to be an outcast.

*   **Social Hierarchy & Law:**
    *   **The Hierarchy:** Based on heat tolerance. The "Pyro-Kin" (those who can withstand the closest proximity to the vents) are the aristocracy. The "Shiverers" (those who require cooler air at the cavern edge) are the servant class.
    *   **Law:** The central law is "Conservation of Pressure." Any action that threatens the stability of the vents is a capital offense.
    *   **Punishment:** The worst punishment is "The Cooling." An offender is shaved bald and tied in a cold, damp crevice away from the vents until they die of hypothermia or fungal infection.

### III. Ecological Survey

*   **Flora & Fungi (Plant-analogues adapted to chemosynthesis):**
    1.  **Iron-Heart Tree:** A towering tube-worm analogue that grows a calcified shell instead of bark. It feeds on mineral water; its wood is harder than bronze.
    2.  **Gloom-Lanterns:** Bulbous fungi that hang from the ceiling, emitting green light. They feed on the sulfur in the rising steam.
    3.  **Scald-Moss:** A velvet-like carpet that grows only on rocks hotter than 50°C. Edible if boiled, but spicy.
    4.  **Wire-Grass:** Sharp, metallic grass that absorbs iron from the mud. Can slice unprotected skin.
    5.  **Blister-Pods:** Explosive flora. If touched, they burst, spraying boiling acid to deter grazers.
    6.  **Steam-Pitcher:** A carnivorous plant shaped like a jug; it fills with hot water and digests insects that fall in seeking a bath.
    7.  **Ash-Cotton:** Grows fibrous, fire-resistant bolls used by the Thermikor to weave protective cloaks.
    8.  **Vent-Vines:** Fast-growing creepers that anchor the soil, preventing mudslides.
    9.  **Sulfur-Morels:** The staple crop. Large, spongy mushrooms that taste like eggs.
    10. **Red-Vein Kelp:** Grows in the boiling mud pools, its leaves floating on the surface to absorb heat.

*   **Bestiary:**
    1.  **Thermikor:** (The Sentient Species).
    2.  **Magma-Strider:** A giant arachnid (size of a pony) with long, stilt-like legs allowing it to walk over boiling mud pools without burning its body. Apex predator.
    3.  **Vent-Hog:** A heavily armored, hairless pig-like creature. It wallows in warm mud and eats fungi. Domesticated for meat and leather.
    4.  **Steam-Ray:** A flat, membrane-like creature that glides on the thermal updrafts near the ceiling, filtering airborne bacteria.
    5.  **Boil-Weevil:** Fist-sized beetles that bore into the Iron-Heart Trees. Their shells are used as bowls.
    6.  **Needle-Bat:** Blind flying mammals that echolocate. They roost in the cooler upper stalactites.
    7.  **Ash-Salamander:** A six-legged lizard that can detach its tail, which explodes into a cloud of hot dust to escape predators.
    8.  **Filter-Crab:** Small crustaceans that cluster around vents, waving feathery arms to catch bacteria.
    9.  **Slag-Worm:** Massive annelids that chew through rock, excreting high-quality soil. Essential for the ecosystem.
    10. **Whisper-Moth:** Moths attracted to heat sources (including body heat). They drink sweat and tears.

### IV. Resource Audit

*   **Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Heat/Thermal Energy:** Infinite supply for cooking, forging, and drying.
    *   **Chitin:** Harvested from Magma-Striders and crabs for armor.
    *   **Fungal Fiber:** From Ash-Cotton for textiles.
    *   **Sulfur:** Scraped from walls, used for medicine and rudimentary explosives.

*   **Non-Renewable Assets:**
    *   **Obsidian:** Used for blades and tools.
    *   **Basalt:** Construction material.
    *   **Pumice:** Used for grinding and cleaning.

*   **The Latent/Unknown Resources (The Uncomprehended):**
    1.  **"Gods-Blood" (Liquid Lithium):** Pools of silvery liquid found deep near the hottest vents. The Thermikor treat it as holy water for anointing, not realizing it is a highly reactive conductive metal indicative of massive battery deposits or reactor leakage below.
    2.  **"Humming-Stones" (Radioactive Isotopes):** Glowing blue stones that remain hot forever. The Gnomes use them as bed-warmers for their elderly. The radiation causes mutations and early death, which they interpret as the "God calling them home."
    3.  **"The Eternal Shell" (Precursor Geothermal Turbine):** The central, largest vent is actually capped by a massive, rusted, artificial alloy structure (ancient technology). The Thermikor believe it is the skull of their progenitor god. If they break it (which they try to do ritually), they could cause a catastrophic explosion or shut down the ventilation system entirely.
